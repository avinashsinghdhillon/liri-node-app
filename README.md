This app accepts user input to choose out off 1 of the 4 search types it can perform and also allows the user to input the search terms.

### Brief Description
The app can seach and display results for songs/tracks, movies and artists/events. Depending on the user selection and search term the result/s are displayed on the terminal window.

### Instructions to Use
